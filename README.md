# Realtime-Sentinel1-Flood-Mapping
A Realtime Flood Mapping Approach ( Change Thresholding) Using Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Data with Open Source Python Packages.

# Objective 
This script provides the user to process Sentinel 1 Data to detect the flood. 

# Functionality
This flood mapping approach gives the user a real-time flood (Water Area Detection) mapping using Sentinel 1 data based on threshold technique.
Open SAR Toolkit (OST), SNAP toolbox, WhiteboxTools, and Orfeo were used in the script.

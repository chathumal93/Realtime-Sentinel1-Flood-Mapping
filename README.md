# Realtime-Sentinel1-Flood-Mapping
A Realtime Flood Mapping Approach ( Change Thresholding) Using Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Data with Open Source Python Packages.

# Objective 
This script will give the user access to process Sentinel 1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data to detect water areas after a disaster, especially a flood, typhoon, or storm.

# Functionality
This flood mapping approach gives the user a real-time flood (Water Area Detection) mapping using Sentinel 1 data based on threshold technique.
Open SAR Toolkit (OST), SNAP toolbox, WhiteboxTools, and Orfeo toolbox were used in this script.
